        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>Forget waiting in the lobby, sitting in your car, or waiting to check in to see family or friends.</p>
        <p>FWIW, or most commonly known as “Forget Where I Was,” is an incredibly fast,  easy to use, and secure universal check-in system that allows quick  and safe entry to any residential or guest lodging, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gated Communities</li>
          <li>Apartment Check-In</li>
          <li>AirBnB</li>
          <li>Gated communities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>FWIW utilizes SMS to contact its users and provides them with a QR code along with directions that can help them allocate their requested establishment.</p>
